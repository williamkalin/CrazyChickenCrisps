# CrazyChickenCrisps

 [My personal website](https://williamkalin.netlify.com/)

A humoristic interactive promotional website for a fake brand of egg-shell based snacks. Everything except the imported animation javascript libraries mainly used for animations have been created by my from scratch. This covers code aswell as the assets/design of the website. Since the project was made for fun there are not external pages such as, contact, info and the contact form does not work.
