# CrazyChickenCrisps

 [My personal website](https://williamkalin.netlify.com/)

A humoristic interactive promotional website for a fake brand of egg-shell based snacks. Everything except the imported animation javascript libraries (mainly used for the main loading animation) have been created by me from scratch. This covers code aswell as the assets/design of the website. Since the project was made for fun there are no additional pages such as, contact, info and the contact form does not work.
